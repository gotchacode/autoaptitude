Description: clang library - Common development package
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and tools
 that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time code generators,
 and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM uses a single,
 language-independent virtual instruction set both as an offline code
 representation (to communicate code between compiler phases and to run-time
 systems) and as the compiler internal representation (to analyze and transform
 programs). This persistent code representation allows a common set of
 sophisticated compiler techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time,
 install-time, run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs). 
 
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end for the LLVM
 compiler. Some of its goals include the following: 
 
 End-User Features: 
 
 * Fast compiles and low memory use 
 * Expressive diagnostics (examples) 
 * GCC compatibility 
   
 Utility and Applications: 
 
 * Modular library based architecture 
 * Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation, etc) 
 * Allow tight integration with IDEs 
 * Use the LLVM 'BSD' License 
   
 Internal Design and Implementation: 
 
 * A real-world, production quality compiler 
 * A simple and hackable code base 
 * A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++ 
 * Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants 
   
 This package contains the clang generic headers.

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL API (shared library)
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop users
 that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other multimedia
 applications. 
 
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation. 
 
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others. 
 
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft shared library.

Description: Extensions to xmonad
 This is a huge extensions library for xmonad, providing alternative layout
 algorithms, key bindings, extended operations, and much more. 
 
 Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
 Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
 reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
 screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
 from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
 Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config
 files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance
 precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action. 
 
 This package is what you need to build your custom configured xmonad binary.

 format. Twisted Names can act as an authoritative server, perform zone
 transfers from a master to act as a secondary, act as a caching nameserver, or
 any combination of these. Twisted Names' client resolver library provides
 functions to query for all commonly used record types as well as a replacement
 for the blocking gethostbyname() function provided by the Python stdlib socket
 module.

Description: Extensions to xmonad; documentation
 This is a huge extensions library for xmonad, providing alternative layout
 algorithms, key bindings, extended operations, and much more. 
 
 Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
 Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
 reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
 screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
 from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
 Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config
 files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance
 precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action. 
 
 This package contains the documentation for building your custom configured
 xmonad binary as well as example configuration files.

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times
 faster at decompression. 
 
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression
 algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally considerably better
 than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and
 approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

 eSpeak is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other languages. 
 
 eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis
 method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines, and sounds quite
 different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but some find the
 articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods. 
 
 It can run as a command line program to speak text from a file or from stdin. 
 
 * Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered. 
 * Can produce speech output as a WAV file. 
 * Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
   for another speech synthesis engine. 
 * Potential for other languages. More than 40 languages are included. 
 * Compact size. The program and its data total about 350 kbytes. 
 * Written in C++.

Description: quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name
 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files anywhere in the
 filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern or a regular expression.
 Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses a previously created database to
 perform the search, allowing queries to execute much faster. This database is
 updated periodically from cron. 
 
 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation from GNU's
 findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate are: 
 
 * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only include
   files that the user running locate has access to. It does this by updating
   the database as root, but making it unreadable for normal users, who can only
   access it via the locate binary. slocate does this as well, but not the
   original locate. 
   
 * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time the
   database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its database and
   can know if the contents of a directory changed without reading them again.
   This makes updates much faster and less demanding on the hard drive. This
   feature is only found in mlocate. 
   
 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to mlocate
 via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may wish to run
 /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database, otherwise mlocate won't
 work until that script is run from cron itself (since mlocate does not use the
 same database file as standard locate). Also, you may wish to remove the
 "locate" package in order not to have two different database files updated
 regularly on your system.

Description: GStreamer plugins for X11 and Pango
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
 media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
 processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. 
 
 This package contains the GStreamer plugins for X11 video output, both for
 standard Xlib support and for the Xv extension, as well as the plugin for
 Pango-based text rendering and overlay.

Description: A tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files
 called `Makefile.am'. 
 
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the
 back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake
 maintainer). 
 
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with rules
 being thrown in occasionally).  The generated `Makefile.in's are compliant with
 the GNU Makefile standards. 
 
 This version of automake is several years out of date and is only provided for
 compatibility will older software. Please do not use it for new projects.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too. 
 
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is another
 IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this object will
 read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The ClientConn
 object also provide methods to send back various responses. 
 
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

 not require Microsoft Windows, however it can use native system dll files in
 place of its own if they are available. 
 
 This package includes a program loader for running unmodified Windows
 executables as well as the Wine project's free version of the Windows API for
 running programs ported from Windows. 
 
 This package provides support for loading 32-bit x86 Windows applications

 Xprint support, is unsupported and not widely used. In general, use of a more
 modern toolkit such as GTK+ is recommended. 
 
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in libxaw7.
 Non-developers likely have little use for this package.

 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on top
 of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it easy
 for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without having to
 write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l consists of
 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2. 
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent of
 the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many v4l2
 drivers do not). 
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary. 
 
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Description: module to parse directory listings
 File::Listing exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be used
 to parse directory listings. 
 
 The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It can be
 a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob representing a
 filehandle to read the directory listing from. 
 
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed. 
 
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel space.
 
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a context-independent
 set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle doesn't do any memory
 allocation or I/O, it simply provides the cryptographic algorithms for the
 application to use in any environment and in any way it needs. 
 
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic algorithms. To
 avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the asymmetric cryptos reside in a
 separate library, libhogweed.

Description: image blending tool
 Enblend is a tool for compositing images. Given a set of images that overlap in
 some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way that the seam between
 the images is invisible, or at least very difficult to see. It can, for
 example, be used to blend a panorama composed of several images. 
 
 It uses a Burt & Adelson multi-resolution spline. This technique tries to make
 the seams between the input images invisible. The basic idea is that image
 features should be blended across a transition zone proportional in size to the
 spatial frequency of the features. For example, objects like trees and
 windowpanes have rapid changes in color. By blending these features in a narrow
 zone, you will not be able to see the seam because the eye already expects to
 see color changes at the edge of these features. Clouds and sky are the
 opposite. These features have to be blended across a wide transition zone
 because any sudden change in color will be immediately noticeable. 
 
 Enblend does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to do
 this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enblend is designed
 to work with.

 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward
 and flexible models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python
 calling and scoping semantics.

 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
 media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
 processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. 
 
 This package contains plugins from the "ugly" set, a set of good-quality
 plug-ins that might pose distribution problems.

Description: an partial implementation of IEC 61883
 This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers,
 and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of
 IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols. 
 
 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV, MPEG-2
 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and transmission.
 It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which transparently provides
 mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also represents the third
 generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for these media types thereby
 removing the complexities of additional kernel modules, /dev nodes, and procfs.
 It also consolidates features for plug control registers and connection
 management that previously existed in experimental form in an unreleased
 version of libavc1394.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection. 
 
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often used in text
 processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix utilities grep, sed and
 awk, and the programming language perl, each of which make extensive use of
 regular expressions. Traditionally C++ users have been limited to the POSIX C
 APIs for manipulating regular expressions, and while regex does provide these
 APIs, they do not represent the best way to use the library. For example regex
 can cope with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C libraries
 can not do.

 number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel
 contains new architectural components originally developed to improve the
 security of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control
 policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based
 Access Control, and Multi-level Security. 
 
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set process and
 file security contexts and to obtain security policy decisions.  Required for
 any applications that use the SELinux API. libselinux may use the shared
 libsepol to manipulate the binary policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the
 policy format to an older version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library (extra)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file
 descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. 
 
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in event driven
 network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event
 ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4). 
 
 The libevent_extra library includes code for HTTP, DNS, RPC, and so on. 
 
 If you're writing software that uses libevent's protocol support, you need to
 link libevent_core and libevent_extra as well.

Description: Python bindings for protocol buffers
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing
 structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define
 how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special
 generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from
 a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update
 your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
 against the "old" format. 
 
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats. 
 
 This package contains the Python bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs. 
 
 This package contains both the traditional Python-based implementation and the
 new C++-based one, and you can select at runtime between the two.

Description: report the search path for a class's ISA tree
 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via its
 @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above). 
 
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl first
 searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes searching in its
 superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe "height-first" is the word)
 search. In the above example, it'd first look in Food::Fish, then Food, then
 Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then Chemicals. 
 
 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the list
 (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with no
 duplicates.

 well as a number of general-purpose improvements, including many patches to
 memtest86 available from various sources. 
 
 Both memtest86 and memtest86+ are being worked on in parallel.

Description: time-series data storage and display system (programs)
 The Round Robin Database Tool (RRDtool) is a system to store and display
 time-series data (e.g. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load
 average). It stores the data in Round Robin Databases (RRDs), a very compact
 way that will not expand over time. RRDtool processes the extracted data to
 enforce a certain data density, allowing for useful graphical representation of
 data values. 
 
 RRDtool is often used via various wrappers that can poll data from devices and
 feed data into RRDs, as well as provide a friendlier user interface and
 customized graphs. 
 
 This package contains command-line programs used to access and manipulate RRDs.

Description: PulseAudio sound server
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with much
 better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture. 
 
 These are some of PulseAudio's features: 
 
 * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for more
   than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards into one
   (with sample rate adjustment). 
   
 * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and GStreamer
   client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio plug-ins are also
   available for xmms and mplayer. 
   
 * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for playback
   and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback streams. 
   
 * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record audio on
   a different machine than the one it is running on. 
   
 * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp lirc
   and avahi, just to name a few. 
   
 This package contains the daemon and basic module set.

Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of this
 software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning). The
 package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon in the
 clamav-daemon package, a command-line scanner in the clamav package, and a tool
 for automatic updating via the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The
 programs are based on libclamav6, which can be used by other software. 
 
 This package contains the command line interface. Features: 
 * built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar, Gzip,
   Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others; 
 * built-in support for almost all mail file formats; 
 * built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files compressed
   with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and obfuscated with SUE,
   Y0da Cryptor and others; 
 * built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft Office and
   Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF. 
   
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options for
 getting it: 
 * clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is recommended
   with Internet access. 
 * clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is not updated
   once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows creating custom packages
   from an Internet-connected computer.

Description: image exposure blending tool
 Enfuse blends differently exposed images of the same scene into a nice output
 image, without producing intermediate HDR images that are then tonemapped to a
 viewable image. This simplified process often works much better and quicker
 than the currently known tonemapping algorithms. 
 
 The exposure blending is done using the Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth exposure fusion
 algorithm. The basic idea is that pixels in the input images are weighted
 according to qualities such as proper exposure, good contrast, and high
 saturation. These weights determine how much a given pixel will contribute to
 the final image. 
 
 Enfuse does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to do
 this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enfuse is designed
 to work with.

 as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and font handling for
 GTK+-2.0. 
 
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with four
 different font backends: 
 * Core X windowing system fonts 
 * Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library 
 * Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library 
 * Native fonts on Microsoft backends 
   
 This package contains the header files and some files needed for development
 with Pango.

 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in event driven
 network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event
 ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4). 
 
 There is now a bufferevent type that supports SSL/TLS using the OpenSSL
 library.  The code for this is build in a separate library, libevent_openssl,
 so that your programs don't need to link against OpenSSL unless they actually
 want SSL support.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor. 
 
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It
 typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times
 faster at decompression. 
 
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression
 algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better

 Its philosophy is to completely hide these complex tasks and only show some
 settings important to the user. 
 
 GNOME power manager displays and manages battery status, power plug events,
 display brightness, CPU, graphics card and hard disk drive power saving, and
 can trigger suspend-to-RAM, hibernate or shutdown events, all integrated to
 other components of the GNOME desktop.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of
 complexity. 
 
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus decreasing
 latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be low-overhead; messages
 are sent using a binary protocol, not using XML. D-Bus also supports a method
 call mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this makes using the
 system quite simple. 
 
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java. 
 
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

 development are open to everybody. The current source code is written to
 support several operating systems, including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various
 Unices and is available under the GNU General Public License (commercial
 applications and backends are welcome, too, however). 
 
 This package includes the backends for many scanners. A libsane-extras package
 containing some not-yet-included backends is available separately. 
 
 Graphical frontends for sane are available in the packages sane and xsane.
 Command line frontend scanimage, saned and sane-find-scanner are available in

Description: scalable PostScript and OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of scalable fonts
 in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are based on the PostScript
 Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts and contain many additional
 characters (mostly accented ones). 
 
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program based on
 MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and they are
 usually considered to be of good quality (compared to cm-super, for instance;
 however, cm-super contains font families that have no equivalent in this
 package; additionally, there are character sets that are supported by cm-super
 and not by the Latin Modern fonts). 
 
 The fonts are setup for use with the TeX typesetting system. They are also
 registered with defoma, which makes them available to other applications such
 as Ghostscript and Fontconfig. Finally, they are made available to the core X11
 fonts system, which makes it possible to use them in any X application.

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs. 
 
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file in two
 directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where two files differ.
 `cmp' can also show all the characters that differ between the two files, side
 by side.  `diff3' shows differences among three files.  `sdiff' merges two
 files interactively. 
 
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute updates to
 text files (such as program source code) to other people. This method is
 especially useful when the differences are small compared to the complete
 files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can update, or "patch", a copy
 of the file.

 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

Description: module for reloading Perl modules when changed on disk
 Apache2::Reload reloads modules that change on the disk. 
 
 When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global hash
 %INC. The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file, it sees the file in
 %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be configured to
 iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have changed on disk. It
 can also monitor only specific modules that have registered themselves with
 Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the check only when a special
 touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number of stat() calls per
 request.

 The library includes four data sources: 
 
 * APT: access the APT database 
 * Debtags: access the Debtags tag information 
 * Popcon: access Popcon package scores 
 * The Xapian index built by apt-xapian-index 
   
 This is the shared library.

Provides: x-terminal-emulator
Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window
 system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of the
 control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals. 
 
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional terminal
 emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is intelligent about
 locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8 character encoding), but
 which requires the luit program from the x11-utils package; koi8rxterm, a
 wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the KOI8-R character set; and
 lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the previous commands to execute
 based on the user's locale settings. 
 
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator is
 provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm. 
 
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package. 
 
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

 runtimes, showing a timeline of spark creation, spark-to-thread promotions and
 garbage collections. 
 
 This helps debugging the parallel performance of Haskell programs, making
 easier to check that work is well balanced across the available processors and
 spot performance issues relating to garbage collection or poor load balancing.

 HTML::Template attempts make using HTML templates simple and natural.  It
 extends standard HTML with a few new HTML-esque tags - <TMPL_VAR>, <TMPL_LOOP>,
 <TMPL_INCLUDE>, <TMPL_IF> and <TMPL_ELSE>.  The file written with HTML and
 these new tags is called a template.  It is usually saved separate from your
 script - possibly even created by someone else!  Using this module you fill in
 the values for the variables, loops and branches declared in the template.
 This allows you to separate design - the HTML - from the data, which you
 generate in the Perl script. 
 
 This module allows you to store its cache in shared memory using the
 IPC::SharedCache module, please install libipc-sharedcache-perl if you want to
 make use of this.

Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), bytecode interpreter
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and tools
 that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time code generators,
 and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM uses a single,
 language-independent virtual instruction set both as an offline code
 representation (to communicate code between compiler phases and to run-time
 systems) and as the compiler internal representation (to analyze and transform
 programs). This persistent code representation allows a common set of
 sophisticated compiler techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time,
 install-time, run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs). 
 
 This package provides the minimal required to execute programs in LLVM format.

 telling your computer how to process files sent to the printer. 
 
 This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the Foomatic
 database as one small compressed archive. This reduces the disk space
 consumption compared to the Foomatic XML database vastly and in addition makes
 listing of all available PPDs and extracting the needed PPD much faster than
 using the Foomatic XML database.

 generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from
 a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update
 your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
 against the "old" format. 
 
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats. 
 
 This package contains the protocol buffer compiler that is used for translating
 from .proto files (containing the definitions) to the language binding for the
 supported languages.

Description: GObject introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library
 This package contains introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library. 
 
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the
 network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the GTK+
 programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who
 want it). 
 
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate dynamic
 bindings.

 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for packet
 capture, and since there are several tools that require this functionality, the
 libpcap authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
 alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules in each
 application.

 content data. As different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
 event handler is invoked. The document to be parsed may also be supplied in
 arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.

 leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
 connections by using this framework. 
 
 This package is the shared library.

Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 Date::Calc is a Perl module which provides a variety of date calculations based
 on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in Western countries today), complying
 with the ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify things such as
 what leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers are defined, what's
 the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a given year has, and so
 on. 
 
 Although the Gregorian calendar was only adopted 1582 by most (not all)
 European countries (some countries continued to use the Julian calendar until
 as late as the beginning of the 20th century!), this package allows you to
 extrapolate the Gregorian calendar back until the year 1. 
 
 If Date::Calc::XS (libdate-calc-xs-perl) is available, this package will
 automatically accelerate its operation using the C/XS implementation.

Description: UPnP IGD client lightweight library
 The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft

 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular. 
 
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.

Description: A system call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out a trace
 of all the system calls made by a another process/program. The program to be
 traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can use it on binaries for which
 you don't have source. 
 
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel interface. A
 close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity
 checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

 OpenChrome is a project for the development of free and open-source drivers for
 the VIA UniChrome video chipsets. 
 
 Originally called the 'snapshot' release, since it was a snapshot of an
 experimental branch of the unichrome cvs code, this is a continued development
 of the open source unichrome driver (from http://unichrome.sf.net) which also
 incorporates support for the unichrome-pro chipsets. 
 
 Support for hardware acceleration (XvMC) for all chipsets has subsequently been
 ripped out of the unichrome.sf.net driver. Therefore your only option if you
 wish to make use of the acceleration features of your VIA chip with free and
 open-source drivers is to use this version of the driver.

Description: time-series data storage and display system (runtime library)
 The Round Robin Database Tool (RRDtool) is a system to store and display
 time-series data (e.g. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server load
 average). It stores the data in Round Robin Databases (RRDs), a very compact
 way that will not expand over time. RRDtool processes the extracted data to
 enforce a certain data density, allowing for useful graphical representation of
 data values. 
 
 This package contains shared libraries used to access and manipulate RRDs.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on top of
 XML::Parser. 
 
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to output
 the parts of it that have been completely processed. 
 
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the tree only for
 the parts of the documents that need actual processing, through the use of the
 twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots options.  The finish and finish_print
 methods also help to increase performance. 
 
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to takes care
 of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes necessary) features that come
 with XML and XML::Parser.

 command line search tool that uses the index. 
 
 axi-cache allows to search packages very quickly, and it also interfaces with
 the shell command line completion in a smart way, providing context-sensitive
 keyword and tag suggestions even before the search command is actually run. 
 
 update-apt-xapian-index allows plugins to be installed in
 /usr/share/apt-xapian-index to index all sorts of extra information, such as
 Debtags tags, popcon information, package ratings and anything else that would
 fit. 
 
 The index generated by update-apt-xapian-index is self-documenting, as it
 contains an autogenerated README file with information on the index layout and
 all the data that can be found in it.

Description: A Python language binding for the ORBit2 CORBA implementation
 It aims to take advantage of new features found in ORBit2 to make language
 bindings more efficient.  This includes: 
 * Use of ORBit2 type libraries to generate stubs 
 * use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation invocation, which
   allows for short circuited invocation on local objects. 
   
 Where it makes sense, this binding tries to stay compatible with the Python
 language mapping, which can be found on the OMG web site:

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased vector-based rendering
 for multiple target backends. Paths consist of line segments and cubic splines
 and can be rendered at any width with various join and cap styles. All colors
 may be specified with optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using
 the extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension. 
 
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the significant
 addition of translucence in the imaging model). When complete, the API is
 intended to support the complete imaging model of PDF 1.4.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file
 descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. 
 
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in event driven
 network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event
 ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4). 
 
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only" or
 "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds the
 libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and libevent_extra.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set (Multiverse Variant)
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
 media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
 processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. 
 
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to
 the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

 Carp::Clan is a Perl module designed to report errors from the perspective of
 the caller of a "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp" itself. Instead of giving
 it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a pattern to
 characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules which shall never be
 blamed for any error. 
 
 These modules stick together like a "clan" and any error which occurs will be
 blamed on the "outsider" script or modules not belonging to this clan.

 for automatic updating via the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The
 programs are based on libclamav6, which can be used by other software. 
 
 This package mainly manages the clamav system account. It is not really useful
 without the clamav package. It also handles the configuration for both the
 clamav-daemon and the clamav-milter packages.

Description: Advanced version control system
 Subversion, also known as svn, is a version control system much like the
 Concurrent Versions System (CVS).  Version control systems allow many
 individuals (who may be distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of
 files (typically source code).  Subversion has all the major features of CVS,
 plus certain new features that CVS users often wish they had. 
 
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), tools to create a Subversion

 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a scanner
 to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions and
 C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which
 defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl
 library to produce an executable. When the executable is run, it analyzes its
 input for occurrences of the regular expressions. Whenever it finds one, it
 executes the corresponding C code. 
 
 This package contains the static library for flex.

Description: versatile resource statistics tool
 Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat and ifstat. Dstat overcomes
 some of the limitations of these programs and adds some extra features. 
 
 Dstat allows you to view all of your network resources instantly, you can for
 example, compare disk usage in combination with interrupts from your IDE
 controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly with the disk
 throughput (in the same interval). 
 
 Dstat also cleverly gives you the most detailed information in columns and
 clearly indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed. 
 
 Dstat is also unique in letting you aggregate block device throughput for a
 certain diskset or network bandwidth for a group of interfaces, i.e. you can
 see the throughput for all the block devices that make up a single filesystem
 or storage system. 
 
 Dstat's output, in its current form, is not suited for post-processing by other
 tools, it's mostly meant for humans to interpret real-time data as easy as
 possible.

Description: Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of web server
 binary, compiled with a different processing model. 
 
 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable number
 of processes where each process handles only one connection at the same time.
 It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to be more stable. It
 is appropriate for sites that need to maintain compatibility with
 non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for isolating each request, so
 that a problem with a single request will not affect any other.

 * Size: small library and lower memory footprint 
 * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later 
 * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol 
 * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking 
 * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
   machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- Shared library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation
 called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate
 packages. 
 
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the
 network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the GTK+
 programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who
 want it). 
 
 Features: 
 * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs 
 * Automatically caches connections 
 * SSL Support using GnuTLS 
 * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling 
 * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication 
 * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication 
 * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories like the
 desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles localization (i.e.
 translation) of the filenames. 
 
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the login
 phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of default
 directories. It then creates localized versions of these directories in the
 users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to ~/.config) that
 applications can read to find these directories.

Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - gs IJS driver (hpijs)
 This package contains an IJS printer driver for Ghostscript, which adds support
 for most inkjet printers and some LaserJet printers manufactured by HP.  It is
 also required for HPLIP fax support. 
 
 The Debian package of hpijs includes the so-called rss patch, to use pure black
 ink instead of composite black in printers that don't do color map conversion
 in firmware. 
 
 HPIJS can take advantage of Ghostscript IJS KRGB support when available, to
 enhance black printing on printers that do color map conversion in firmware and
 are thus not affected by the old rss patch. 
 
 Users of the CUPS printing system are advised to also install the hplip
 package, and use the hp CUPS backend to send data to the printer. HPLIP
 supports USB, networked and parallel-port devices, and enables extended HPIJS
 functionality such as border-less printing. Selecting any hpijs ppd in CUPS
 will use hpijs automatically. 
 
 HPIJS is meant to be used through the foomatic system (see the foomatic-filters
 package).

Description: OpenPrinting printer support - programs
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up common
 printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems). It provides the
 "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and your actual printer, by
 telling your computer how to process files sent to the printer. 
 
 This package contains the architecture-dependent programs needed to set up and
 maintain the foomatic system.  You will also need one or more database
 packages.  The foomatic-db package includes drivers for most common printers
 using Ghostscript as the print processor, as well as some common glue code used
 in other filter systems.

Description: next generation TeX engine
 LuaTeX uses Lua scripting both as an extension to the TeX macro language and as
 an extension to the typesetting engine itself. A (growing) number of TeX
 internals are made available to the embedded lua interpreter. 
 
 LuaTeX uses code and interfaces from Aleph to improve the typesetting of
 non-latin alphabet languages, instead of the TeXXeT code present in the current
 releases of pdfTeX. 
 
 Unicode and OpenType font support are added progressively, and regular pdfTeX
 development will continue in this branch as well. 
 
 The multi-lingual extensions are coded and merged by Taco Hoekwater. Swift
 progress in that area is made possible by a joint grant from Colorado State
 University and TUG, under the 'Oriental TeX' project. 
 
 This package only contains the barebone binary. If you are searching for
 support file, formats etc install texlive-luatex.

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize, move, and

 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further documentation is
 available in parted-doc. 
 
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98 partitioning
 formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. It
 can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS, Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS,
 linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS file systems. Parted also has the ability to
 create and modify file systems of some of these types, but using it to perform
 file system operations is now deprecated. 
 
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive data loss.
 While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they could exist, so please
 back up all important files before running it, and do so at your own risk.

 either Dvips and Ghostscript or dvipng, but it also works when using PDFTeX for
 generating PDF files.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on top of
 XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's expat
 library.  Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance of
 XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document.  Expat options may
 be provided when the XML::Parser object is created.  These options are then
 passed on to the Expat object on each parse call.  They can also be given as
 extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options given
 at XML::Parser creation time. 
 
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method.  These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat.  If neither Style
 nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for being
 well-formed. 
 
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter the
 Expat object, not the Parser object.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library (core)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file
 descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. 
 
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in event driven
 network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll, kqueue(2), event
 ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4). 
 
 The libevent_core library includes event loops, timers, buffer code, and
 various small compatibility functions. 
 
 If you're writing software that only uses libevent's event loop, you should
 link against only the libevent_core library.

 * The m17n library for any Linux/Unix applications. 
 * The m17n library realizes multilingualization of many aspects of
   applications. 
 * The m17n library represents multilingual text as an object named M-text.
   M-text is a string with attributes called text properties, and designed to
   substitute for string in C.  Text properties carry any information required
   to input, display and edit the text. 
 * The m17n library supports functions to handle M-texts. 
   
 m17n is an abbreviation of Multilingualization.

Description: Access much of the Toshiba laptop hardware interface
 Toshset is a command-line tool to allow access to much of the Toshiba laptop
 hardware interface developed by Jonathan Buzzard. It can do things like set the
 hard drive spin-down time, turn off the display and set the fan speed without
 the help of the kernel. Toshset requires an experimental version of the
 toshiba_acpi kernel module with an ACPI-enabled kernel. Otherwise it works only
 if the laptop supports the old APM BIOS. (The last of these was produced
 something like 5 years ago) Please read README.Debian how to install the
 experimental version of the toshiba_acpi kernel module. (Ubuntu users don't
 need it) 
 
 This package also includes the Toshsat1800-irdasetup by Daniele Peri.  It can
 be used to configure IrDA for laptops with ALI1533 bridge (LPC47N227 SuperIO),
 smc-ircc and not initializing BIOS (tested on Toshiba Satellite 1800-514).

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing non-uniform
 resizing of images by the seam-carving technique. 
 
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts them to a
 multi-size representation. 
 
 Following is a list of features: 
 
 * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard 
 * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done in
   real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out later without
   any further processing 
 * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically performs all
   the necessary operations; it can also work in successive steps without
   wasting computational time 
 * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be less
   connected, or more rigid, or both 
 * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams) 
 * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process as the
   parent image 
 * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by selecting among
   different energy gradient functions 
 * Reports progress through a customizable interface 
 * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors 
   
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam Carving for
 Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir, which can be
 found at http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf 
 
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: User Theme extension to GNOME Shell
 The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
 particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications, accessing
 documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it will introduce a new
 applets eco-system and offer new solutions for other desktop features, such as
 notifications and contacts management. The GNOME Shell is intended to replace
 functions handled by the GNOME Panel and by the window manager in previous
 versions of GNOME. The GNOME Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new
 graphical technologies. 
 
 GNOME Shell is extensible using extensions. The gnome-shell-extensions-*
 packages contain official GNOME Shell extensions. 
 
 This extension adds theming support to GNOME Shell. With this extension, you
 can personalize the looks of GNOME Shell with themes installed in ~/.themes/ or
 in /usr/share/themes. For a GUI way to install/remove themes, install package
 gnome-tweak-tool.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of the Secure
 Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working group. 
 
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for
 executing commands on a remote machine. It provides secure encrypted
 communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11
 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure
 channel. It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel. 
 
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent and ssh-add
 programs to make public key authentication more convenient, and the ssh-keygen,
 ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities. 
 
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all without a
 special permit. 
 
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are obsolete for
 most purposes.

Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM), C language family frontend
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and tools
 that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time code generators,
 and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM uses a single,
 language-independent virtual instruction set both as an offline code
 representation (to communicate code between compiler phases and to run-time
 systems) and as the compiler internal representation (to analyze and transform
 programs). This persistent code representation allows a common set of
 sophisticated compiler techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time,
 install-time, run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs). 
 
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end for the LLVM
 compiler. Some of its goals include the following: 
 
 End-User Features: 
 
 * Fast compiles and low memory use 
 * Expressive diagnostics (examples) 
 * GCC compatibility 
   
 Utility and Applications: 
 
 * Modular library based architecture 
 * Support diverse clients (refactoring, static analysis, code generation, etc) 
 * Allow tight integration with IDEs 
 * Use the LLVM 'BSD' License 
   
 Internal Design and Implementation: 
 
 * A real-world, production quality compiler 
 * A simple and hackable code base 
 * A single unified parser for C, Objective C, C++, and Objective C++ 
 * Conformance with C/C++/ObjC and their variants

 and select them according to requirements specified by applications. 
 
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a particular
 rasterization library on the application. The X-specific library 'Xft' uses
 fontconfig along with freetype to specify and rasterize fonts. 
 
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache (fc-cache), a
 sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program to test the
 matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary cache files in
 string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma available to
 fontconfig applications.

Description: Documentation tool for annotated Haskell source code
 Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from annotated
 Haskell source code.  It is primary intended for documenting libraries, but it
 should be useful for any kind of Haskell code. 
 
 Haddock lets you write documentation annotations next to the definitions of
 functions and types in the source code, in a syntax that is easy on the eye
 when writing the source code (no heavyweight mark-up).  The documentation
 generated by Haddock is fully hyperlinked: click on a type name in a type
 signature to go straight to the definition, and documentation, for that type. 
 
 Haddock can generate documentation in multiple formats; currently HTML is
 implemented, and there is partial support for generating DocBook. 
 
 This package contains Haddock version 2.10.0.

 with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can be used for multiple
 purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably
 identifying very persistent objects across a network. 
 
 See RFC 4122 for more information. 
 
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon. 
 
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based UUID??s, in a
 secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of large numbers of
 threads trying to grab UUID??s running on different CPU??s. It is used by
 libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in terms of
 complexity. 
 
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus decreasing
 latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be low-overhead; messages
 are sent using a binary protocol, not using XML. D-Bus also supports a method
 call mapping for its messages, but it is not required; this makes using the
 system quite simple. 
 
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java. 
 
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities. 
 
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

 Events are received via kernel netlink messaged and processed according to
 rules in /etc/udev/rules.d and /lib/udev/rules.d, altering the name of the
 device node, creating additional symlinks or calling other tools and programs
 including those to load kernel modules and initialise the device.

 to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over Xlib: 
 
 * Size: small library and lower memory footprint 
 * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later 
 * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol 
 * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking 
 * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
   machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 A flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive technology that provides

 GNOME desktop). With early input from and continued engagement with its end
 users, Orca has been designed and implemented by the Sun Microsystems, Inc.,
 Accessibility Program Office. 
 
 Orca defines a set of default behaviors (reactions to application events) and
 key bindings (reaction to user key presses). These default behaviors and key
 bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis. Orca creates a script
 object for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
 and key bindings, and the application specific ones. Orca provides the
 infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host of
 services accessible from within the scripts.

Description: Numerical Python adds a fast array facility to the Python language
 Numpy contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated
 (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, and
 useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. 
 
 Numpy replaces the python-numeric and python-numarray modules which are now
 deprecated and shouldn't be used except to support older software.

Description: Lightweight X11 window manager; libraries
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language. See
 http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell. 
 
 Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
 Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
 reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
 screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
 from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
 Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config
 files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance
 precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action. 
 
 This package is what you need to build your custom configured xmonad binary.

Description: system for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbols
 in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and
 derived from the tsipa package, made in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and
 Shirakawa Shun. 
 
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as compared
 with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA symbols: 
 
 * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which includes all
   the symbols and diacritics found in the recent versions of IPA and some
   non-IPA symbols. 
 * Complete support of LaTeX2e. 
 * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles. 
 * Easy input method in the IPA environment. 
 * Extended macros for accents and diacritics. 
 * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'. 
 * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams. 
 * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with Times Roman and
   Helvetica fonts. 
   
 Type 1 fonts for TIPA are also included in this package (to make them available
 in X11 applications other than LaTeX, please install the xfonts-tipa package).

 layers, and it shows for every active process the CPU utilization in system and
 user mode, the virtual and resident memory growth, priority, username, state,
 and exit code. The process level activity is also shown for processes which
 finished during the last interval, to get a complete overview about the
 consumers of things such as CPU time.

Description: Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)
 The Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) is a collection of libraries and tools
 that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, Just-In-Time code generators,
 and many other compiler-related programs. LLVM uses a single,
 language-independent virtual instruction set both as an offline code
 representation (to communicate code between compiler phases and to run-time
 systems) and as the compiler internal representation (to analyze and transform
 programs). This persistent code representation allows a common set of
 sophisticated compiler techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time,
 install-time, run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs). 
 
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely simple design (which
 makes it easy to understand and use), source-language independence, powerful
 mid-level optimizer, automated compiler debugging support, extensibility, and
 its stability and reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide
 variety of academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker), a young
 scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can generate code
 for X86, SparcV9, PowerPC, or it can emit C code. 
 
 LLVM is the key component of the clang compiler and the gcc plugin called
 dragonegg.

Description: Lightweight X11 window manager; documentation
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language. See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on
 Haskell. 
 
 Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
 Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
 reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
 screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
 from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
 Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config
 files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance
 precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action. 
 
 This package contains the documentation for building your custom configured
 xmonad binary as well as example configuration files.

 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with four
 different font backends: 
 * Core X windowing system fonts 
 * Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library 
 * Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library 
 * Native fonts on Microsoft backends

Description: multimedia player and streamer (without X support)
 VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4,
 DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, WebM, FLAC, MP3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs,
 podcasts, and multimedia streams from various network sources. 
 
 VLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates the stream it reads
 and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves them
 through HTTP. 
 
 VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either
 for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for most
 output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added by
 installing additional audio plugins (vlc-plugin-pulse, vlc-plugin-sdl,
 vlc-plugin-jack) or video plugins (vlc-plugin-sdl). 
 
 This package contains a version of VLC that does not require X and that is thus
 suitable for headless servers.

 Speech Dispatcher provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis. It
 supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as backends and
 provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and playing back PCM data via
 those different backends to applications. 
 
 Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech and
 application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
 independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from having to
 yet again reinvent the wheel. 
 
 This package contains a Python library for communication with Speech
 Dispatcher.

Description: panorama photo stitcher - GUI tools
 Hugin is a panorama photo stitching program. Essentially, Hugin is a GUI
 frontend for Panorama Tools. Stitching is accomplished by using several
 overlapping photos taken from the same location, and using control points to
 align and transform the photos so that they can be blended together to form a
 larger image. Hugin allows for the easy creation of control points between two
 images, optimization of the image transforms, and much more. 
 
 This package includes the following graphical interfaces, using the
 command-line tools provided in the hugin-tools package: 
 * hugin                - Hugin panorama creator. 
 * hugin_stitch_project - Hugin batch stitcher. 
 * nona_gui             - Graphical interface for nona. 
 * PTBatcherGUI         - Batch controller for the stitching process. 
 * calibrate_lens_gui   - Lens calibration tool.

 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.).  The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide
 the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. 
 
 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is intended
 to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your system.
 Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save your system
 from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the available
 builtin commands.

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provide support for using https schemed URLs
 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so
 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access
 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS. 
 
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and neither
 SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be the one
 provided by ca-certificates. 
 
 This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need https support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

Description: Development files for MIT Kerberos without Heimdal conflict
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a third
 party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on the network
 (users and services, usually called "principals"). 
 
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5. 
 
 Most users wishing to build applications against MIT Kerberos should install
 libkrb5-dev.  However, that package conflicts with heimdal-dev. This package
 installs libraries and headers in /usr/include/mit-krb5 and /usr/lib/mit-krb5
 and can be installed along side heimdal-multidev, which provides the same
 facilities for Heimdal.

 The reference implementation of the D-Bus interface can be found in
 gnome-packagekit. It was also adpoted by KPackageKit. 
 
 In contrast to gnome-packagekit and KPackageKit it doesn't use the PackageKit
 daemon for querying and installation, but instead makes use of APT and
 aptdaemon (alternatively synaptic can be used).

 server is created automatically when necessary and holds a number of sessions,
 each of which may have a number of windows linked to it. Any number of clients
 may connect to a session, or the server may be controlled by issuing commands
 with tmux. Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in
 /tmp. Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key binding,
 or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key layouts.

 * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and 10-bit image
   file formats. 
 * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format. 
 * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included codecs
   can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with film grain. 
 * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily be added by
   extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR software distribution. New
   image attributes (strings, vectors, integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR
   image headers without affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
   applications.

 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator (or to
 the user in question); you should probably install a mail system as well so
 that you can receive these messages. 
 
 This cron package is configured by default to do some basic daily system
 maintenance tasks. Other packages, such as checksecurity, can provide further
 maintenance tasks.

 This tool implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local
 Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration
 from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central server.
 It is primarily intended to be used in ad-hoc networks which lack a DHCP
 server.

 signals to service daemons without the need for pid-files, and a log facility
 with automatic log file rotation and disk space limits. 
 
 runit service supervision can run under sysv init or replace the init system
 completely.  Complete init replacement requires some manual configuration
 described in the supplied documentation.

 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis on
 internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is needed.
 however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+ widget toolkit
 as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and font handling for
 GTK+-2.0. 
 
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with four
 different font backends: 
 * Core X windowing system fonts 
 * Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library 
 * Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library 
 * Native fonts on Microsoft backends 
   
 This package can be used by other packages using the GIRepository format to
 generate dynamic bindings.

Description: cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like `anac(h)ronistic') is a periodic command scheduler.  It executes
 commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it does not assume that
 the system is running continuously.  It can therefore be used to control the
 execution of daily, weekly and monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n

Description: mode switching data for usb-modeswitch
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act like a
 flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If the driver is
 already installed, the storage device vanishes and a new device, such as an USB
 modem, shows up. This is called the "ZeroCD" feature. 
 
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a Linux kernel
 module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still shows up as
 "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that issue by sending the
 command which actually performs the switching of the device from "usb-storage"
 to "usbserial". 
 
 This package contains the commands data needed for usb-modeswitch.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web using HTTP(S) and FTP,
 the two most widely used internet protocols. It works non-interactively, so it
 will work in the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP sites -- you can use
 Wget to make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the web like a WWW
 robot. 
 
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections by continuing to
 retrieve a document until the document is fully downloaded. Re-getting files
 from where it left off works on servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it.
 Both HTTP and FTP retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically retrieve the new
 version if it has. 
 
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load, speed up
 retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion. 
 
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality. 
 
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: Lightweight X11 window manager written in Haskell
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language. See
 http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell. 
 
 Xmonad is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.
 Windows are managed using automatic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically
 reconfigured. At any time windows are arranged so as to maximise the use of
 screen real estate. All features of the window manager are accessible purely
 from the keyboard: a mouse is entirely optional.  Xmonad is configured in
 Haskell, and custom layout algorithms may be implemented by the user in config
 files. A principle of Xmonad is predictability: the user should know in advance
 precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action. 
 
 This package comes pre-configured with the default configuration. If you want
 to build your custom-configured version, make sure that libghc-xmonad-dev is
 installed and put your configuration in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs

Description: TeX Portable Graphic Format
 pgf stands for `portable graphics format'. It is a TeX macro package that
 allows you to create graphics in your TeX documents using a special pgfpicture
 environment and special macros for drawing lines, curves, rectangles, and many
 other kind of graphic objects. Its usage closely resembles the pstricks package
 or the normal picture environment of LaTeX. 
 
 Although pgf is less powerful than \pstricks, it has the advantage that it can
 generate both PostScript output and pdf output from the same file. The pgf
 package works together both with dvips and pdftex. In particular, packages that
 rely on pdftex or pdflatex (like some packages for creating presentations) can
 be used together with pgf.

Description: management daemon for Telepathy real-time communication framework
 Telepathy Mission Control 5 is an account manager and channel dispatcher for
 the Telepathy framework, allowing user interfaces and other clients to share
 connections to real-time communication services without conflicting. It
 implements the AccountManager and ChannelDispatcher D-Bus APIs as described by
 telepathy-spec. 
 
 The account manager part stores real time communication account details,
 connects to the stored accounts on request, and sets the accounts' presence,
 nickname and avatar according to requests from Telepathy user interfaces and
 other components. 
 
 The channel dispatcher part responds to incoming communication channels
 (message streams, voice/video calls, file transfers etc.) by dispatching them
 to suitable user interfaces, and requests outgoing communication channels
 according to requests from a Telepathy UI. 
 
 This is not a compatible replacement for Mission Control 4 (in the
 telepathy-mission-control package), but they can be installed in parallel.

Depends: libpthread-stubs0 (= 0.3-3)
Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided in libc
 or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely on pthread stubs
 to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when linked to libpthread,
 while avoiding any performance hit when running single-threaded.
 libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on platforms which do not supply
 all the necessary pthread stubs. 
 
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this package
 ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow libraries to
 unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and still obtain correct
 behavior.

 DCE/RPC, NTLM is also used throughout Microsoft's systems as an integrated
 single sign-on mechanism. 
 
 NTLM employs a challenge-response mechanism for authentication, in  which
 clients are able to prove their identities without sending a  password to the
 server. It consists of three messages, commonly referred  to as Type 1
 (negotiation), Type 2 (challenge) and Type 3 (authentication).

Description: A fast lexical analyzer generator.
 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a scanner
 to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions and
 C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source file, lex.yy.c, which
 defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled and linked with the -lfl
 library to produce an executable. When the executable is run, it analyzes its
 input for occurrences of the regular expressions. Whenever it finds one, it
 executes the corresponding C code.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of
 the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech transcoding,
 prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse excitation/long term
 prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s. 
 
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling rate, i.e. a
 frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility with typical UNIX
 applications, our implementation turns frames of 160 16-bit linear samples into
 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s). The quality of the algorithm is good enough for
 reliable speaker recognition; even music often survives transcoding in
 recognizable form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate). 
 
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and a
 library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime on most
 SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the ETSI standard
 test patterns.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act like a
 flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If the driver is
 already installed, the storage device vanishes and a new device, such as an USB
 modem, shows up. This is called the "ZeroCD" feature. 
 
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a Linux kernel
 module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still shows up as
 "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that issue by sending the
 command which actually performs the switching of the device from "usb-storage"
 to "usbserial". 
 
 This package contains the binaries and the brother scripts.

Depends: debconf (>= 1.5.19), coreutils (>= 5.91)
Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior is to
 make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg handles the file
 specially during upgrades, prompting the user as needed. 
 
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default version that
 will work for most installations, although some system administrators may
 choose to modify it. This implies that the default version will be part of the
 package distribution, and must not be modified by the maintainer scripts during
 installation (or at any other time). 
 
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that may not
 be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package, but handled by
 the postinst instead. This script allows one to maintain files in /etc,
 preserving user changes and in general offering the same facilities while
 upgrading that dpkg normally provides for 'conffiles'. 
 
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a file that had
 not been provided with conffile-like protection to come under this schema, and
 attempts to minimize questions asked at installation time. Indeed, the
 transitioning facility is better than the one offered by dpkg while
 transitioning a file from a non-conffile to conffile status.

Description: high-performance event loop library modelled after libevent
 libev provides a full-featured and high-performance event loop that is loosely
 modelled after libevent. It includes relative timers, absolute timers with
 customized rescheduling, synchronous signals, process status change events,
 event watchers dealing with the event loop itself, file watchers, and even
 limited support for fork events. It uses a priority queue to manage timers and
 uses arrays as fundamental data structure. It has no artificial limitations on
 the number of watchers waiting for the same event. 
 
 libev supports select, poll, epoll, kqueue, and inotify.

 much help to you. 
 
 Some manufacturers distribute PPD files for their printers under non-free
 licenses; those are not included in this package, but may be available from the
 manufacturer's website, included on a CD or other media with the printer, or
 downloadable from the OpenPrinting web site (even automatically if the printer

 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities such
 as network connections, modems, increased memory, etc. 
 
 To use PCMCIA you need to have kernel modules available to support it. These
 are included in the stock Debian 2.6 kernel packages. You will most likely also
 need udev, although it isn't always required. 
 
 The wireless-tools package is required by many wireless network adapters.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
 media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
 processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. 
 
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to
 the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

 This package contains a CUPS-Raster-based printer driver which adds support for
 most inkjet printers and some LaserJet printers manufactured by HP. It does not
 provide PPDs for the fax functionality of HP's multi-function devices. 
 
 Users of the CUPS printing system are advised to also install the hplip
 package, and use the hp CUPS backend to send data to the printer. HPLIP
 supports USB, networked and parallel-port devices, and enables extended hpcups
 functionality such as border-less printing. Selecting any hpcups ppd in CUPS
 will use hpcups automatically. 
 
 No physical PPDs are shipped with this driver. PPDs are dynamically generated
 via a CUPS DDK .drv file. 
 
 This package can be installed to provide a minimal headless printer solution
 using CUPS.

Description: HTTP library implementation in C -- GNOME support library
 It was originally part of a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation
 called Soup, but the SOAP and non-SOAP parts have now been split into separate
 packages. 
 
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers on the
 network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to the GTK+
 programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also supported for those who
 want it). 
 
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to GNOME
 apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME apps may not
 want to add dependencies on. 
 
 Features: 
 * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs 
 * Automatically caches connections 
 * SSL Support using GnuTLS 
 * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling 
 * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication 
 * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication 
 * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support 
   
 This package contains the GNOME support shared library.

 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters which
 operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything from
 real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything else
 media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data types or
 processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new plug-ins. 
 
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to
 the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use. 
 
 This package contains shared GStreamer libraries from the "bad" set. The API is
 not guaranteed to be stable.

Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features: 
 
 * Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax. 
 * Support for modern partition maps such as GPT. 
 * Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
   add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
   update-grub2. 
 * VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
   color set. 
 * Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
   entries. 
   
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It will not automatically install GRUB as
 the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade,
 so most people should install grub-pc instead.

Description: The GNU Image Manipulation Program
 GIMP is an advanced picture editor. You can use it to edit, enhance, and
 retouch photos and scans, create drawings, and make your own images. It has a
 large collection of professional-level editing tools and filters, similar to
 the ones you might find in Photoshop. Numerous fine-control settings and
 features like layers, paths, masks, and scripting give you total control over
 your images. 
 
 Many image file formats are supported, including JPEG, Photoshop (.psd), and
 Paint Shop Pro (.psp) files. It can also be used to scan and print photos. 
 
 To open files remotely (like over HTTP), install the gvfs-backends package. 
 
 To use a MIDI device (like a musical keyboard) as an input controller in GIMP,
 install libasound2 and read the how-to at /usr/share/doc/gimp/README.MIDI

 VLC is the VideoLAN project's media player. It plays MPEG, MPEG-2, MPEG-4,
 DivX, MOV, WMV, QuickTime, WebM, FLAC, MP3, Ogg/Vorbis files, DVDs, VCDs,
 podcasts, and multimedia streams from various network sources. 
 
 VLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates the stream it reads
 and multicasts them through the network to other clients, or serves them
 through HTTP. 
 
 VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and video formats, either
 for broadcasting purposes or for movie format transformations. Support for most
 output methods is provided by this package, but features can be added by
 installing additional audio plugins (vlc-plugin-pulse, vlc-plugin-sdl) or video
 plugins (vlc-plugin-sdl).

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package. Other
 packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they should use `perl'
 (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from files
 called `Makefile.am'. 
 
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance from the
 back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back of the Automake
 maintainer). 
 
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions (with rules
 being thrown in occasionally).  The generated `Makefile.in's are compliant with
 the GNU Makefile standards. 
 
 Automake 1.11 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake 1.4, 1.6,
 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and 1.10 did, so has been renamed so that the previous version
 can continue to be made available.

Description: date and time handling routines for Python
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new objects,
 DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you store and handle
 date/time values in a much more natural way than by using ticks (seconds since
 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation used by Python's time module). 
 
 You can add, subtract and even multiply instances, pickle and copy them and
 convert the results to strings, COM dates, ticks and some other more esoteric
 values. In addition, there are several convenient constructors and formatters
 at hand to greatly simplify dealing with dates and times in real-world
 applications. 
 
 In addition to providing an easy-to-use Python interface the package also
 exports a comfortable C API interface for other extensions to build upon. This
 is especially interesting for database applications which often have to deal
 with date/time values (the mxODBC package is one example of an extension using
 this interface). 
 
 mxDateTime can convert between various different date/time storage formats,
 including COM dates, TJD, MJD, JDN, tuples and, probably most important,
 strings. 
 
 The date/time parser included in mxDateTime is one of the most flexible such
 parser available for Python. It is constantly being improved to make parsing
 date/time strings as easy as possible. At the same time, it offers a fully
 customizable interface which allows selecting valid date/time formats from a
 range of predefined categories. 
 
 There are also special parser and formatter modules for ARPA and ISO date/time
 formats, which are handy if you work a lot with Internet standards.

 * conversions of Exif and IPTC metadata to XMP and vice versa 
 * a smart IPTC implementation that does not affect data that programs like
   Photoshop store in the same image segment 
 * Exif Makernote support: - Makernote tags can be read and written just like
   any other metadata - a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the
   Makernote 
 * a simple interface to extract previews embedded in RAW images and Exif

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression
 format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful compression (often better
 than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression. 
 
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ compression,
 including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can also handle the older
 LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate symlinks will emulate the behavior
 of the commands in the lzma package. 
 
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use: 
 
 * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files; 
 * crc64 data integrity check; 
 * limited random-access reading support; 
 * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils); 
 * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library
 libdaemon is a leightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts: 
 
 * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process 
 * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR 
 * An API for writing PID files 
 * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll() 
 * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog 
   
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable. 
 
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

Description: free implementation of the OpenGL API -- DRI modules
 This version of Mesa provides GLX and DRI capabilities: it is capable of both
 direct and indirect rendering.  For direct rendering, it can use DRI modules
 from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing. 
 
 This package does not include the OpenGL library itself, only the DRI modules
 for accelerating direct rendering. 
 
 For a complete description of Mesa, please look at the libgl1-mesa-swx11
 package. 
 
 The tdfx DRI module needs libglide3 to enable direct rendering.

Description: Multi-format archive and compression library (shared library)
 The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and writing
 archives in various formats such as tar and cpio. libarchive also supports
 reading and writing archives compressed using various compression filters such
 as gzip and bzip2. The library is inherently stream-oriented; readers serially
 iterate through the archive, writers serially add things to the archive. 
 
 Archive formats supported are: 
 
 * tar (read and write, including GNU extensions) 
 * pax (read and write, including GNU and star extensions) 
 * cpio (read and write, including odc and newc variants) 
 * iso9660 (read only, including Joliet and Rockridge extensions, with some
   limitations) 
 * zip (read only, with some limitations, uses zlib) 
 * mtree (read and write) 
 * shar (write only) 
 * ar (read and write, including BSD and GNU/SysV variants) 
 * empty (read only; in particular, note that no other format will accept an
   empty file) 
 * raw (read only) 
 * xar (read only) 
 * rar (read only, with some limitations) 
 * 7zip (read and write, with some limitations) 
   
 Filters supported are: 
 
 * gzip (read and write, uses zlib) 
 * bzip2 (read and write, uses bzlib) 
 * compress (read and write, uses an internal implementation) 
 * uudecode (read only) 
 * separate command-line compressors with fixed-signature auto-detection 
 * xz and lzma (read and write using liblzma) 
   
 This package provides the libarchive shared library.

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out. 
 
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: run common desktop actions without password
 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password: 
 
 * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks) 
 * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet) 
 * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through KDE)
 * Adding/changing system-wide NetworkManager connections 
 * Update already installed software 
 * Configure printers 
   
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "admin" or "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use case
 where the user has full control over the hardware anyway. 
 
 This is implemented by shipping a pklocalauthority(8) file.

 for localization you will most probably never have any use for. It is run
 automagically upon completion of any apt installation actions. 
 
 Please note, that this tool is a hack which is *not* integrated with Debian's
 package management system and therefore is not for the faint of heart. This
 program interferes with the Debian package management and does provoke strange,
 but usually harmless, behaviour of programs related with apt/dpkg like
 dpkg-repack, reportbug, etc. Responsibility for its usage and possible breakage
 of your system therefore lies in the sysadmin's (your) hands. 
 
 Please definitely do abstain from reporting any such bugs blaming localepurge
 if you break your system by using it. If you don't know what you are doing and
 can't handle any resulting breakage on your own then please simply don't use

 * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol 
 * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking 
 * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
   machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: convert PostScript to EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files
 ps2eps is a tool to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual
 one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those
 EPS files and filters some special postscript command sequences that can
 produce erroneous results on printers.  EPS files are needed for including
 (scalable) graphics into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like
 ps2epsi do not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values
 are put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript code)
 or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of the image.
 Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 dpi to get the correct bounding box.

Description: A droid derived Sans-Seri style CJK font
 WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei,
 Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality CJK
 outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid Sans" and
 "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package contains two
 faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a True-Type Collection
 (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e. GBK Hanzi, in the range of
 U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1 are covered, with additional
 support to many other international languages such as Latin, Extended Latin,
 Hanguls and Kanas. The font file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most
 known CJK fonts. As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded
 systems, or used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because
 both font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs, they
 are the excellent choices for desktop fonts.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will. 
 
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west". GNU
 grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about twice as fast
 as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper search for a fixed
 string that eliminates impossible text from being considered by the full regexp
 matcher without necessarily having to look at every character. The result is
 typically many times faster than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions
 containing backreferencing will run more slowly, however.)

Description: Cyrus SASL - authentication abstraction library
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.1. 
 
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for adding
 authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use SASL, a protocol
 includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server and
 for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If
 its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and
 the connection. See RFC 2222 for more information. 
 
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal Kerberos 5),
 NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. If you intend to use this package on a
 server that provides SASL authentication, then you must install some of the
 libsasl2-modules* packages.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks accurate by
 synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network, or by following an
 accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS, DCF-77, NIST or similar time
 signals. 
 
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match the time
 obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It is not sufficient,
 however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the long run.  ntpdate by itself
 is useful for occasionally setting the time on machines that do not have
 full-time network access, such as laptops. 
 
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then ntpdate is not
 necessary.

Description: MJPEG video capture/editting/playback MPEG encoding
 The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos and
 playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of audio and
 video under Linux. This package combines them with important supporting
 libraries required for their use. 
 
 The "lavrec" utility supplied supports capture from Zoran based MJPEG
 capture/playback cards like the Buz (Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle) and the
 LML33 (Linux Media Labs). Compatible MJPEG avi files can also be created using
 any frame-grabbing card supported by the xawtv tool. 
 
 Videos recorded in this can be filtered, editted, and converted to MPEG
 streams. The MPEG encoder is optimised for high quality results at medium to
 high bit-rates (1Mbps upwards) and supports MMX/SSE/3D-Now and SMP. A Duron 700
 can deliver around 15-20 352x288 frames per second. 
 
 A key design objective of the tools is interoperability with other video tools:
 currently xawtv, bcast2000, nuppelvideo and vcdimager are known to
 interoperate. The MJPEG utilities can read AVI, Quicktime, and movtar streams.
 The MPEG encoder can produce streams suitable for buring to VCD/SVCD using
 vcdimager or similar tools. The software playback of MPEG streams works with
 almost every player and every OS. SSE/MMX and 3D-Now! are supported permitting
 a 700Mhz CPU to deliver arond 15-20 VCD frames/second.

Description: LaTeX class to produce presentations
 The beamer class is a LaTeX class that allows you to create a beamer
 presentation. It can also be used to create slides. It behaves similarly to
 other packages like Prosper, but has the advantage that it works together
 directly with pdflatex, but also with dvips. 
 
 Once you have installed the beamer class, the basic steps to create a beamer
 presentation are the following: 
 * Specify beamer as document class instead of article. 
 * Structure your LaTeX text using \section and \subsection commands. 
 * Place the text of the individual slides inside \frame commands. 
 * Run pdflatex on the text (or latex and dvips). 
   
 The beamer class has several useful features: You don't need any external
 programs to use it other than pdflatex, but it works also with dvips. You can

 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be used.
 
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL API (data files)
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop users
 that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other multimedia
 applications. 
 
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation. 
 
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others. 
 
 This package installs data files used by the OpenAL Soft shared library.

 party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on the network
 (users and services, usually called "principals"). 
 
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5. 
 
 This package contains the internal Kerberos database libraries.

 ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it exits.
 While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records the dynamic
 library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals received
 by that process. It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by
 the program. 
 
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can use it on
 binaries for which you don't have the source handy. 
 
 You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the
 execution of processes.

Description: Perl module implementing object oriented interface to SSL sockets
 This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that uses SSL to
 encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server or client.
 IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one needs to write a
 full-featured SSL client or server application: multiple SSL contexts, cipher
 selection, certificate verification, and SSL version selection.  As an extra
 bonus, it works perfectly with mod_perl. 
 
 IO::Socket::SSL uses IPv6 if libio-socket-inet6-perl is installed.

Description: Extensions to extend functionality of GNOME Shell (common files)
 The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
 particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications, accessing
 documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it will introduce a new
 applets eco-system and offer new solutions for other desktop features, such as
 notifications and contacts management. The GNOME Shell is intended to replace
 functions handled by the GNOME Panel and by the window manager in previous
 versions of GNOME. The GNOME Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new
 graphical technologies. 
 
 GNOME Shell is extensible using extensions. The gnome-shell-extensions-*
 packages contain official GNOME Shell extensions. 
 
 This package contains common files to be used by other individial extension
 packages.

Description: The CELT codec runtime library
 CELT is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay communication. 
 
 CELT stands for "Code-Excited Lapped Transform". It applies some of the CELP
 principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of
 the limitations of CELP. CELT is suitable for both speech and music and
 currently features: 
 
 * Ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms) 
 * Full audio bandwidth (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz) 
 * Stereo support 
 * Packet loss concealment 
 * Constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above 
 * A fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder 
   
 The CELT codec is meant to close the gap between Vorbis and Speex for
 applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired. 
 
 This package provides the celt runtime library.

 The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of
 PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic
 B?zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and
 antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any
 affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)

 code. Libvisual allows applications to use existing visualization plugins
 written for the libvisual framework.

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide
 the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU counterparts. 
 
 busybox-initramfs provides a simple stand alone shell that provides only the
 basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

 * Size: small library and lower memory footprint 
 * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later 
 * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol 
 * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking 
 * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
   machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 This package provides an 'update-binfmts' script with which package maintainers
 can register interpreters to be used with this module without having to worry
 about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins can use for a
 slightly higher-level interface to this module.

 This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a database
 of all the HTTP cookies that a given LWP::UserAgent object knows about. 
 
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily. 
 
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Description: GLib Telepathy connection manager library (GObject-Introspection)
 This package contains introspection data for telepathy-glib, which can be used
 to generate dynamic bindings for Telepathy components. 
 
 These GObject-Introspection bindings are considered to be experimental by the
 maintainers of telepathy-glib, and might receive incompatible changes until at
 least telepathy-glib 0.14.0. 
 
 Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication, including
 instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts differences
 between protocols to provide a unified interface for applications.

 This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
 streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library so
 it has high performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
 compression formats. 
 
 It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the few
 cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib feature
 set.

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information by
 constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and network
 design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where these tools
 might be particularly useful include: 
 
 * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand the
   relationships between its types, procedures, and source files 
 * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
   individual links, but their relationships 
 * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a finite
   state machine and need to figure out how a certain error state arises 
 * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or distributed
   program represented graphically 
 * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents 
 * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a database
   of telephone calls or e-mail messages 
   
 This package contains the command-line tools.

 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing
 structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define
 how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special
 generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from
 a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update
 your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled
 against the "old" format. 
 
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats. 
 
 This package contains the runtime library needed for the protocol buffer
 compiler.

Description: Audio/Video communications framework: core library
 The Farstream project is an effort to create a framework to deal with all known
 audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a generic API that
 makes it possible to write plugins for different streaming protocols, on the
 other side it offers an API for clients to use those plugins. 
 
 This package provides the core Farstream library.

Description: module providing low-level HTTP connection client
 The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the Net::HTTP
 class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The HTTP protocol is
 described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.
 Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET. You can mix its methods with
 reading and writing from the socket directly. This is not necessarily a good
 idea, unless you know what you are doing.

 GLUT is a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs,
 implementing a simple windowing API, which makes learning about and exploring
 OpenGL programming very easy. 
 
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs,
 however it is not a full-featured toolkit, so large applications requiring
 sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system
 toolkits like GTK+ or Motif.

 GIO is striving to provide a modern, easy-to-use VFS API that sits at the right
 level in the library stack. The goal is to overcome the shortcomings of
 GnomeVFS and provide an API that is so good that developers prefer it over raw
 POSIX calls. Among other things that means using GObject. It also means not
 cloning the POSIX API, but providing higher-level, document-centric interfaces.

 executable, it can be applied to any task where a set of target files must be
 created based on a set of input files, based on dependency and processing
 rules. Indeed, Make is a general purpose dependency solver.

Description: SSH-based gatekeeper for git repositories
 Gitolite is an SSH-based gatekeeper providing access control for a server that

 gitolite lets you do that just using SSH public keys tied to a single, common,
 user that hosts all the repositories. 
 
 Gitolite can restrict who can read (clone/fetch) from or write (push) to a
 repository, and who can push to what branch or tag - an important issue in
 corporate environments. Other features include: 
 * access control by branch-name or by modified file/directory; 
 * per-developer "personal namespace" prefixes; 
 * simple but powerful configuration file syntax (with validation); 
 * config files (and authority for maintaining them) can be split; 
 * easy integration with gitweb; 
 * comprehensive logging; 
 * easy migration from gitosis.

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams. 
 
 The main features in libmpeg2 are: 
 
 * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
   certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2 is
   probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
   extensive test suite to check this. 
   
 * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
   fastest library around for what it does. 
   
 * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
   optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back on.
   This should be portable to all architectures - at least we have heard reports
   from people running this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4. 
   
 * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific code,
   but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse
   projects. 
   
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - development
 Static libraries and include files for the bzip2 compressor library. 
 
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It
 typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times
 faster at decompression. 
 
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression
 algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally considerably better
 than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and
 approaches the performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors. 
 
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can be used
 to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes an advanced key
 management facility and is compliant with the proposed OpenPGP Internet
 standard as described in RFC 4880. 
 
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to the version
 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes with no support for S/MIME
 and some other tools useful for desktop environments, but also with less
 dependencies. 
 
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support HKPS
 keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use the keyserver
 helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS. 
 
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be compatible
 with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in a number of countries).

 implements the AWK language as defined in Aho, Kernighan and Weinberger, The
 AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred
 to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition
 of the AWK language which contains a few features not described in the AWK
 book, and mawk provides a small number of extensions. 
 
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time limits such
 as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: rootkit, backdoor, sniffer and exploit scanner
 Rootkit Hunter scans systems for known and unknown rootkits, backdoors,
 sniffers and exploits. 
 
 It checks for: 
 * MD5 hash changes; 
 * files commonly created by rootkits; 
 * executables with anomalous file permissions; 
 * suspicious strings in kernel modules; 
 * hidden files in system directories; 
 and can optionally scan within files. 
 
 Using rkhunter alone does not guarantee that a system is not compromised.
 Running additional tests, such as chkrootkit, is recommended.
